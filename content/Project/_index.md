# Project Overview

## Objective

Our primary objective is to determine if a patient can die from heart failure by applying machine learning classification algorithms to clinical data. We aim to provide a model that can predict patient survival based on various clinical features.

## Dataset Introduction

The dataset used in this project is the Heart Failure Clinical Records Dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository. It contains medical records of 299 patients who had heart failure, with 12 clinical features and one target feature indicating whether the patient deceased during the follow-up period.

### Dataset Features

- **age**: Age of the patient (years)
- **anaemia**: Decrease of red blood cells or hemoglobin (boolean)
- **creatinine_phosphokinase**: Level of the CPK enzyme in the blood (mcg/L)
- **diabetes**: If the patient has diabetes (boolean)
- **ejection_fraction**: Percentage of blood leaving the heart at each contraction
- **high_blood_pressure**: If the patient has hypertension (boolean)
- **platelets**: Platelets in the blood (kiloplatelets/mL)
- **serum_creatinine**: Level of serum creatinine in the blood (mg/dL)
- **serum_sodium**: Level of serum sodium in the blood (mEq/L)
- **sex**: Woman or man (binary)
- **smoking**: If the patient smokes or not (boolean)
- **time**: Follow-up period (days)
- **DEATH_EVENT**: If the patient deceased during the follow-up period (boolean)

The dataset consists of 299 instances with no missing values, making it suitable for analysis without extensive data cleaning.
